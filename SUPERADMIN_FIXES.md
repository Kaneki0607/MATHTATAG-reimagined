# SuperAdminDashboard Fixes - Summary

## Errors Fixed

### 1. Missing Export Functions in `lib/elevenlabs-keys.ts`

**Problem**: The SuperAdminDashboard was trying to import `deleteApiKey` and `deleteAllApiKeys` functions that didn't exist in the elevenlabs-keys module.

**Solution**: Added two new exported functions to `lib/elevenlabs-keys.ts`:

```typescript
/**
 * Delete a specific API key
 * @param keyToDelete - The API key to delete
 * @returns true if deleted, false if not found
 */
export const deleteApiKey = (keyToDelete: string): boolean => {
  const initialLength = apiKeys.length;
  apiKeys = apiKeys.filter(k => k.key !== keyToDelete);
  const deleted = apiKeys.length < initialLength;
  
  if (deleted) {
    console.log(`🗑️ Deleted API key: ${keyToDelete.substring(0, 10)}...`);
  }
  
  return deleted;
};

/**
 * Delete all API keys
 * @returns number of keys deleted
 */
export const deleteAllApiKeys = (): number => {
  const count = apiKeys.length;
  apiKeys = [];
  console.log(`🗑️ Deleted all ${count} API keys`);
  return count;
};
```

### 2. Type Mismatch in API Key Data

**Problem**: The `getApiKeyStatus()` function returns objects with `index` property and Date objects for `addedAt` and `lastUsed`, but the `ElevenKey` interface expected `id` as a string and date fields as strings.

**Solution**: 
- Updated the `ElevenKey` interface to accept both Date and string types for date fields
- Added `index` as an optional property
- Mapped the API key data to include an `id` field using the key itself

```typescript
// Updated interface
interface ElevenKey {
  id: string;
  key: string;
  status?: string;
  creditsRemaining?: number;
  addedAt?: string | Date;
  lastUsed?: string | Date;
  usageCount?: number;
  index?: number;
}

// Updated data mapping in fetchAll()
const apiKeyStatus = await getApiKeyStatus();
// Map the keys to include id field
const keysWithId = apiKeyStatus.keys.map((k, idx) => ({
  ...k,
  id: k.key, // Use the key itself as the ID
}));
setApiKeys(keysWithId);
```

### 3. Non-existent Property Access

**Problem**: Line 561 was trying to access `apiKey.fullKey` which doesn't exist in the `ElevenKey` interface.

**Solution**: Changed to use `apiKey.key` instead:

```typescript
// Before
await deleteApiKey(apiKey.fullKey);

// After
await deleteApiKey(apiKey.key);
```
