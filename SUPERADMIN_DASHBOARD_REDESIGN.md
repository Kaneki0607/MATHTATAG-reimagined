- Loading and refreshing states
- Modal state for teacher profiles

### Firebase Integration
- Real-time data fetching from:
  - `/teachers`
  - `/admins`
  - `/elevenlabsKeys`
  - `/teacherLogs`
- Write operations for admin access:
  - Update `/teachers/{uid}/isAdmin`
  - Create/Delete `/admins/{uid}`

### Performance
- Efficient tab switching (data loaded once)
- Pull-to-refresh on all tabs
- Search filtering on client-side
- Lazy loading of modals

2. Navigate to Teachers tab
3. Click on teacher card
4. Teacher profile modal opens
5. Click "Grant Admin Access" button
6. System:
   - Updates /teachers/{uid}/isAdmin → true
   - Creates /admins/{uid} record
   - Shows success alert
7. Teacher badge updates to show "Admin"
8. Teacher can now login via AdminLogin
9. Teacher is routed to AdminDashboard
```

### Revoking Admin Access

```

2. Navigate to Teachers tab

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Super Admin Access
- Only users with UIDs in `SUPER_ADMIN_UIDS` array
- Code-level security (requires deployment to change)
- Full system access

### Admin Access Control
- Only super admins can grant/revoke admin access
- Changes logged with timestamps
- Automatic Firebase record management
- No self-elevation (teachers can't make themselves admins)

### Data Protection
- All operations require authentication
- Firebase security rules should enforce permissions
- Admin records linked to teacher records

## 📊 Analytics & Monitoring

### Available Metrics (Home Tab)

**Counts:**
- Total Teachers
- Total Admins
- Total API Keys
- Total Logs
- Verified Teachers
- Pending Teachers
- Blocked Teachers
- Teachers with Admin Access
- Active API Keys

**Use for:**
- System health monitoring
- Growth tracking
- Resource planning (API keys)
- Security audits (blocked teachers, admins)

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

**Potential Features:**
- [ ] Add new API keys directly from dashboard
- [ ] Delete/edit API keys
- [ ] More detailed analytics charts
- [ ] Export logs to CSV
- [ ] Email notifications for admin access changes
