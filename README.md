# MATHTATAG - Reimagined üßÆ

A modern React Native Expo application built with cutting-edge technologies for mathematical learning and engagement.

## üöÄ Quick Setup

Run this single command to set up everything:

```bash
npm run setup
```

This single command will:
- ‚úÖ Install all dependencies with proper peer dependency resolution
- ‚úÖ Create necessary configuration files (babel.config.js, metro.config.js, expo-env.d.ts)
- ‚úÖ Install missing packages (react-native-worklets)
- ‚úÖ Fix Expo package versions
- ‚úÖ Set up the project for immediate development

## üì± Start Development

After running the setup command, start the development server:

```bash
# Start with cache cleared (recommended)
npm run start:clear

# Or use the regular start command
npm start

# Platform-specific commands
npm run android    # Start on Android
npm run ios        # Start on iOS  
npm run web        # Start on web
```

## üåê Deploy to Vercel (Web)

This app is ready for Vercel deployment! See **[VERCEL_SETUP.md](./VERCEL_SETUP.md)** for step-by-step instructions.

Quick deploy:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for deployment"
git push
```

Then import your repository on [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and deploy in one click!

## üì¶ Build for Production

```bash
# Build web version
npm run build:web

# Build Android APK (requires EAS CLI)
eas build --platform android --profile preview

# Build for production
eas build --platform android --profile production
```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
